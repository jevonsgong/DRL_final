# Comparative Analysis of Strategies in Multi-Agent RL Environments

## Project Overview

This project explores the effectiveness of cooperative and competitive strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments, specifically focusing on the Simple Tag and Simple Reference scenarios from the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE). The aim is to evaluate which strategies yield higher rewards and how they impact agent behavior.

## Objectives

- To compare cooperative and competitive strategies in controlled multi-agent environments.
- To determine the impact of these strategies on the performance and reward maximization of agents.

## Environments

- **Simple Tag**: A game where multiple predator agents chase a single prey.
- **Simple Reference**: Two agents need to learn to communicate to solve tasks.

## Installation

To run the simulation and analysis scripts:
pip install pettingzoo[mpe]

clone the repo, create conda env and just python DQNagent.py or python MADDPGagent.py
Some parameters might need to be changed in the code for full duplication of the simulation.
